# ðŸ§ª AEFI Predictor: Machine Learning for Vaccine Safety in Ethiopia

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts **Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)** using machine learning models trained on health surveillance data from Ethiopia.

Developed as part of a Masterâ€™s Thesis in Data Science at [Your University], this app aims to support public health analysis and early detection of adverse vaccine responses.
